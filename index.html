                Chimchar, the Monkey Pokémon. 
                Chimchar easily climbs the sheerest 
                of walls and lives on mountain tops. When it 
                sleeps, its flames go out.

                Piplup, the Penguin Pokémon. Although not the most sure-footed, it is proud nonetheless, getting right back up after a fall with head held high.
